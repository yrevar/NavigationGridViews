# Navigation Grid Visualization

A lightweight Python3 library for visualizing high-dimensional data. Explicitly designed for experimental research on Navigation problems. However, the core components could be used in many applications.

It is built on Matplotlib to provide an easy interface for 2D representation and annotation of high dimensional state space. For instance, using just one line of code, one could:
- Render n x n state space.
- Label each state.
- Enable state/feature level grid.
- Draw trajectories
- Visualize features such as one-hot indicator variable, vector, and RGB image.
